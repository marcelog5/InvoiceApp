SAP - Single Responsibility Principle

Should separate things that change for different reasons

DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

OCP - Open/Closed Principle

Closed for modification, open for extension
Create extension points in the code that allow add new functionality without modifying existing code
